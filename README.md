#Lyrical Wordsmithery - using .select method
## Experimenting using the .select method on arrays

###### THE SELECT METHOD

`.select` - Used for pulling out or 'selecting' certain items based on some defined critera.
Can be used on arrays or hashes

It will run the block you want on every item of your object and return a new
object that contains only those items that the original block returned true.
